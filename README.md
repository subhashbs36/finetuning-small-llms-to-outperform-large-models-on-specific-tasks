## 🧾 Dataset Creation

We used **OpenAI GPT-4o via Azure** to synthetically generate QA pairs from long paragraphs:
- Extracted 2–5 key points from a paragraph.
- Randomly removed 1–4 key points to simulate incomplete answers.
- Generated JSON in the format:

```json
{
  "Answer": "paragraph with missing key points",
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2", ...],
  "PointsMissed": ["missing_point1", "missing_point2"]
}
```
